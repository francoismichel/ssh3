# SSH3: faster and rich secure shell using HTTP/3
SSH3 is a complete revisit of the SSH
protocol, mapping its semantics and behaviours on top of the HTTP mechanisms.
In a nutshell, SSH3 offers very similar features to SSH, but uses QUIC+TLS1.3 for
secure channel establishment and the HTTP Authorization mechanism for user authentication.
In short, the SSH3 architecture allows the following improvements, among others:
- Significantly faster session establishment
- New HTTP authentication methods like OpenID Connect in addition to classical passwords and pubkey authentication
- Robustness to port scanning attacks: your SSH3 server can be made **invisible** to other Internet users
- UDP port forwarding in addition to classical TCP port forwarding
- All the features allowed by the modern QUIC protocol: including soon connection migration and multipath connection 

*SSH3* stands for the concatenation of *SSH* and *H3*. 

## ‚ö° SSH3 is faster
SSH3 offers a significantly faster session establishment than SSHv2. Running a single command with SSHv2 can take between 8 and 6 network round-trips, which can easily be noticed by the user. SSH3 only needs 3 round-trips. On a connection with 50 milliseconds of ping, this reduces the session establishment time from 400 with SSHv2 to 150ms with SSH3. The keystroke latency during a running session is unchanged.


## üîí SSH3 is secure
While SSHv2 defines its own protocols for user authentication and secure channel establishment. SSH3 relies on the robust and time-tested mechanisms of TLS 1.3, QUIC and HTTP extensively used to secure security-critical applications on the Internet such as e-commerce and Internet banking.

While some lesser-used authentication methods might currently be missing compared to the OpenSSH SSHv2 implementation, **SSH3 already implements the common password-based and public-key (RSA and EdDSA/ed25519) authentication methods.** SSH3 also allows new authentication method that were not natively supported by SSHv2 such as OAuth 2.0 and allows logging in to your servers using your Google/Microsoft/Github accounts.

## ü•∑ Your SSH3 public server can be hidden
Using SSH3, you can avoid the usual stress of scanning and dictionnary attacks against your SSH server. Similarly to your secret Google Drive documents, your SSH3 server can be hidden behind a secret link and only answer to authentication attempts that made an HTTP request to this specific link, like the following:

    ssh3-server -bind 192.0.2.0:443 -url-path <my-long-secret>

By replacing `<my-long-secret>` by, let's say, the value `M3MzkxYWMxMjYxMjc5YzJkODZiMTAyMjU`, your SSH3 server will only answer to SSH3 connection attempts made to the URL `https://192.0.2.0:443/M3MzkxYWMxMjYxMjc5YzJkODZiMTAyMjU` and it will respond a `404 Not Found` to other requests. Attackers and crawlers on the Internet can therefore not detect the presence of your SSH3 server. It will only see a simple web server answering 404 status codes to every request.

## üíê SSH3 is already features-rich
